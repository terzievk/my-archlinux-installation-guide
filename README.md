After rocking arch for 5+ years as a sole os I'm taking my ssd upgrade as an opportunity to have some fun with a fresh install.

Starting point: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide

One of the greatest assets of the archlinux community is the extensive wiki. One of the coolest features of the wiki is every page has a history of updates(with diffs too). Assuming changes down the line I'll be linking my wiki references with the latest versions as of the day I write this.

I'm following [this version of the installation guide.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=General_recommendations&oldid=859535)

## 1 Pre-installation

Apparently there's an "official" way to create an Arch Linux Installer USB drive on Android. That's what I'll do. Sounds fun and since I have no other machine laying around or os that's what I'll do.

### 1.1 Acquire an installation image

Viait the [Download](https://archlinux.org/download/) page. I am going with the recommended BitTorrent Download using [uTorrent](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utorrent.client&hl=en)(mainly for historical reasons, despite the ads).
